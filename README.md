In April 2022, towards the end of the crypto boom, I launched one of my projects, the explosive baby otters. 2048 baby otters, each with a function to explode half of the remaining baby otters. Perhaps even ours?

It was fun, I created a character, Professor Otterlove, and hosted a Discord server. It was fully onchain, so the art will be forever on the blockchain. And mint is still free :).

The front-end is developed using Vue.js. You can explore all the mechanics in the contract (including the management of randomness for the explosion).
